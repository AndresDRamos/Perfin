# STATE

Active context of the repo. Curated by `/commit-plan`. Keep it short: only what is *active*.

## Active milestones

- **Bootstrap** (`0001-bootstrap`, active) -- scaffold landed. Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript +
  Drizzle/Postgres(Supabase). `domain/` layer (money, balances, available, credit) with unit tests in
  place; ADRs 001-005 recorded. Initial migration `0000` generated **and applied** -- live schema is
  `account` + single-table `ledger_entry`.
- **Next**: vertical slice (create account -> capture cleared expense -> see derived balance &
  available) to prove the model end to end, then layer remaining tables (categories, budgets, fixed
  expenses) module by module via `/plan-module`.

## Active risks

- Derived-balance queries may slow as the ledger grows -- mitigate with indexes / materialized read
  models *only if needed* (always derived, never authoritative state).
- Date/timezone handling for cutoff/payment-day derivation -- `occurred_at` stored explicitly; fix a
  single TZ for v1.
- Loose end: `src/data/schema/transaction.ts` exists but is not exported from `schema/index.ts`
  (superseded by the single-table `ledger_entry` model) -- dead file to remove.

## Active logic

- Single user, single currency (**MXN**) for v1. Simplest model that stays correct (not double-entry).
- Balances are **derived from the ledger** (per-account opening balance + sum of transactions); never a stored mutable field.
- **Available** = liquid *cleared* balances (cash + debit + investment). Credit debt is a separate liability surfaced by payment date; **not** subtracted from available.
- Two readings of available: *real* (cleared only) vs *projected* (incl. `projected` income).
- Ledger is a **single `ledger_entry` table**. Kinds: `income` / `expense` count toward categories & budgets; `transfer` is **excluded** from those totals. `amount` is stored as a **positive** integer (centavos); direction is set by kind (repositories translate to signed `domain.Money`). Status is `cleared` / `projected`.
- Credit statements & dues are **derived** from transaction dates vs the card's cutoff/payment days -- not stored as mutable records. v1 assumes pay-in-full (no revolving interest).
- Investment annual rate is effective-dated history, **informational only** -- no automatic interest posting.
